% Example:
% Kalman filter for GPS positioning
% This file provide an example of using the Extended_KF function with the
% the application of GPS navigation. The pseudorange and satellite position
% of a GPS receiver at fixed location for a period of 25 seconds is
% provided. Least squares and Extended KF are used for this task.
%
% The following is a brief illustration of the principles of GPS. For more
% information see reference [2].
% The Global Positioning System(GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system
% that provides a user with proper equipment access to positioning
% information. The most commonly used approaches for GPS positioning are
% the Iterative Least Square(ILS) and the Kalman filtering(KF) methods.
% Both of them is based on the pseudorange equation:
%                rho = || Xs - X || + b + v
% in which Xs and X represent the position of the satellite and
% receiver, respectively, and || Xs - X || represents the distance between
% them. b represents the clock bias of receiver, and it need to be solved
% along with the position of receiver. rho is a measurement given by
% receiver for each satellites, and v is the pseudorange measurement noise
% modeled as white noise.
% There are 4 unknowns: the coordinate of receiver position X and the clock
% bias b. The ILS can be used to calculate these unknowns and is
% implemented in this extample as a comparison. In the KF solution we use
% the Extended Kalman filter (EKF) to deal with the nonlinearity of the
% pseudorange equation, and a CV model (constant velocity)[1] as the process
% model.
